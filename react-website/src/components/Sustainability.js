            At <strong>Greentwiste Growers and Exporters</strong>, located in
            Kenya, sustainability is not just a practice; itâ€™s a way of life. We
            believe in protecting the environment while providing the freshest,
            highest-quality herbs. Our sustainable farming practices and
            eco-friendly packaging ensure that we deliver fresh herbs
            responsibly, while minimizing our environmental footprint.
          </p>

            <h2>Sustainable Farming Practices</h2>
            <p>
              Our farms are designed with sustainability in mind. We employ a
              range of environmentally friendly techniques to ensure that we
              protect the soil, conserve water, and preserve biodiversity.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Advanced irrigation systems,
                such as drip irrigation, allow us to use water efficiently,
                reducing waste and supporting local ecosystems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Crop Diversity:</strong> We practice crop rotation and
                grow a variety of herbs to maintain soil health and protect
                biodiversity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Our farms are gradually
                shifting toward renewable energy sources, such as solar power, to
                reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="eco-friendly-packaging">
            <h2>Eco-Friendly Packaging</h2>
            <p>
              We take great care in ensuring that our packaging is as green as
              possible. Our packaging materials are carefully chosen to reduce
              waste while keeping our herbs fresh.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Biodegradable Packaging:</strong> Our herbs are packed
                in biodegradable materials, made from plant-based sources like
                cornstarch, which decompose naturally.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Minimal Plastic Usage:</strong> Wherever possible, we
                minimize the use of plastic, and ensure any plastic used is
                fully recyclable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Compostable Labels:</strong> We use labels made from
                recycled paper and printed with eco-friendly inks, so they can
                easily be composted or recycled.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Together, these practices allow us to deliver the freshest, most
            flavorful herbs while protecting the planet for future generations.
